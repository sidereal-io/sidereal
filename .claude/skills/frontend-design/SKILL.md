This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction.  What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision.

Then implement working code that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend CSS Guildelines
Focus on:
- **Consistent Methodology**: Apply and stick to the project's consistent CSS methodology
- **Avoid Overriding Framework Styles**: Work with your framework's patterns rather than fighting against them with excessive overrides
- **Maintain Design System**: Establish and document design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) for consistency
- **Minimize Custom CSS**: Leverage framework utilities and components to reduce custom CSS maintenance burden
- **Performance Considerations**: Optimize for production with CSS purging/tree-shaking to remove unused styles

## Frontend Componenet Design Guidelines
Focus on:
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component should have one clear purpose and do it well
- **Reusability**: Design components to be reused across different contexts with configurable props
- **Composability**: Build complex UIs by combining smaller, simpler components rather than monolithic structures
- **Clear Interface**: Define explicit, well-documented props with sensible defaults for ease of use
- **Encapsulation**: Keep internal implementation details private and expose only necessary APIs
- **Consistent Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names that indicate the component's purpose and follow team conventions
- **State Management**: Keep state as local as possible; lift it up only when needed by multiple components
- **Minimal Props**: Keep the number of props manageable; if a component needs many props, consider composition or splitting it
- **Documentation**: Document component usage, props, and provide examples for easier adoption by team members

## Frontend Responsive Design Guidelines
Focus on:
- **Standard Breakpoints**: Consistently use standard breakpoints across the application (e.g., mobile, tablet, desktop)
- **Fluid Layouts**: Use percentage-based widths and flexible containers that adapt to screen size
- **Relative Units**: Prefer rem/em units over fixed pixels for better scalability and accessibility
- **Test Across Devices**: Test and verify UI changes across multiple screen sizes from mobile to tablet to desktop screen sizes and ensure a balanced, user-friendly viewing and reading experience on all
- **Touch-Friendly Design**: Ensure tap targets are appropriately sized (minimum 44x44px) for mobile users
- **Performance on Mobile**: Optimize images and assets for mobile network conditions and smaller screens
- **Readable Typography**: Maintain readable font sizes across all breakpoints without requiring zoom
- **Content Priority**: Show the most important content first on smaller screens through thoughtful layout decisions

## Frontend Accessibility Guidelines

**IMPORTANT**: Strive to meet WCAG 2.1 AA when possible

Focus on:
- **Semantic HTML**: Use appropriate HTML elements (nav, main, button, etc.) that convey meaning to assistive technologies
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard with visible focus indicators
- **Color Contrast**: Maintain sufficient contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text) and don't rely solely on color to convey information
- **Alternative Text**: Provide descriptive alt text for images and meaningful labels for all form inputs
- **Screen Reader Testing**: Test and verify that all views are accessible on screen reading devices.
- **ARIA When Needed**: Use ARIA attributes to enhance complex components when semantic HTML isn't sufficient
- **Logical Heading Structure**: Use heading levels (h1-h6) in proper order to create a clear document outline
- **Focus Management**: Manage focus appropriately in dynamic content, modals, and single-page applications

NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.
