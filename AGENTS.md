# Sidereal — Agent Guide

**Sidereal** is a self-hosted photo gallery and management system for astrophotographers. It integrates with [Immich](https://immich.app/) to provide plate solving (via Astrometry.net), equipment tracking, and deep-sky imaging metadata management.

**Stack:** TypeScript monorepo · React 19 + Vite (frontend) · Hono (backend) · Drizzle ORM · SQLite (default) / PostgreSQL · Playwright (E2E)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm (comes with Node)
- Docker (optional — only needed for container workflows)

No external database required for local development; SQLite is used by default.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
```

Copy the example env file before running locally:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

## Key Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start full stack: server + frontend + worker |
| `npm run dev:server` | Backend server only |
| `npm run dev:frontend` | Vite dev server only |
| `npm run dev:worker` | Worker process only |
| `npm run check` | TypeScript type checking — **run this after every change** |
| `npm run test` | Unit tests (`packages/shared/src/**/*.test.ts`) |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Playwright E2E tests (requires app on port 5173) |
| `npm run build` | Production build (frontend + backend) |
| `npm run db:migrate` | Apply Drizzle migrations |
| `npm run docker:build` | Build Docker image |
| `npm run docker:run` | Start via docker-compose |

## Architecture

### Backend

- **Framework:** Hono — lightweight, edge-compatible web framework
- **Pattern:** One route file per resource in `apps/server/src/routes/`. Business logic lives in `apps/server/src/services/`. Long-running work goes in `apps/server/src/workers/`.
- **Adding a new endpoint:** Create a route file, register it in the server entry point, add shared types/schemas in `packages/shared/`.

### Database

- **ORM:** Drizzle — type-safe query builder
- **Default:** SQLite (`local.db` locally, `/app/config/sidereal.db` in Docker)
- **Optional:** PostgreSQL — set `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...`
- **Schemas:** `packages/shared/src/db/sqlite-schema.ts` and `postgres-schema.ts`
- **Migrations:** Generated to `tools/migrations/sqlite/` and applied automatically on startup

### Frontend

- **Data fetching:** TanStack React Query
- **Routing:** Wouter
- **Real-time updates:** WebSocket
- **UI components:** shadcn/ui — prefer these over writing custom components
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4

### Validation

- **Library:** Zod — always validate at API boundaries
- **Location:** `packages/shared/src/schemas/`

## Code Conventions

- **Modules:** ES modules (`import`/`export`) throughout — no CommonJS
- **TypeScript:** Strict mode; avoid `any`
- **Commits:** Conventional Commits — `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`
- **UI:** Use shadcn/ui components when available; follow existing Tailwind patterns
- **Linting:** Follow the existing style in surrounding code

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `5000` | Server port |
| `NODE_ENV` | `development` | Environment |
| `DATABASE_URL` | *(unset)* | PostgreSQL connection string; omit to use SQLite |
| `STORAGE_PATH` | `./data/images` (`/app/data/images` in container) | Root directory for local image storage (`processed/` subtree) |

Runtime configuration (Immich API key, Astrometry.net API key, sync schedules, plate-solving settings) is managed through the admin UI at `/admin` and persisted in the database — it takes precedence over environment variables.

See `.env.example` and `.env.worker.example` for the full list.

## Testing

- Run `npm run check` after every change — this is the minimum bar.
- Unit tests live alongside source in `packages/shared/src/`.
- E2E tests use the Page Object Model; page objects are in `tests/e2e/pages/`.
- E2E tests require the dev server running (`npm run dev`) before invoking `npm run test:e2e`.

## CI/CD

- **Every PR:** TypeScript check + Docker build (AMD64 only)
- **Merge to `main`:** Multi-arch Docker build (amd64 + arm64) pushed to GHCR
- **Semver tag (`v*.*.*`):** Full release — multi-arch image, SBOM, GitHub release with artifacts

## Decision Records

When you encounter a design decision with multiple valid approaches, create a decision record before implementing. Decision records ensure developers can review trade-offs and make informed choices rather than discovering baked-in assumptions after the fact.

### When to create a decision record

- Trade-offs between simplicity and flexibility (e.g., hardcoded defaults vs. config)
- Anything where a reasonable person could argue for a different approach

### Decision record format

New ADRs follow `docs/decisions/ADR-000-template.md`. Number sequentially (`ADR-NNN-short-slug.md`) and keep the slug terse.

### Rules
- Do NOT implement a decision before it's recorded. Write the record, set status to Proposed, and let a developer accept it.
- Number sequentially: 001, 002, etc.
- Keep options concrete — include code snippets, interface sketches, or config examples where they clarify trade-offs.
- If a decision is later reversed, set status to Superseded by NNN and create a new record explaining why.

### Lifecycle

Every DR moves through these states:

- **Proposed** — authored but not reviewed. Do not implement.
- **Accepted** — reviewed and approved. Implementation may proceed (or has).
- **Superseded** by NNN — the decision has been reversed or replaced. Keep the original file; add a pointer line at the top to the replacement.
- **Archived** — the decision no longer applies (feature removed, approach abandoned without replacement). Leave the file in place; prefix the title with [Archived] and add a one-line note under Status.

When you open a PR that implements an Accepted DR, flip its status in the same PR. When you supersede a DR, do it in the PR that introduces the replacement. A DR should never linger in Proposed once the corresponding code ships — treat a mismatched status as a correctness bug on par with stale docs.

## Release Process

Releases are driven by git tags. Do not create releases manually with `gh release create`.

1. Bump the version in `package.json`.
2. Add a changelog entry to `CHANGELOG.md` under a new version heading.
3. Commit and push to main.
4. Create and push a semver tag: `git tag v<version> && git push origin v<version>`.
5. The `release.yml` workflow handles everything else: builds, security scan, multi-arch Docker image push (with `latest`, semver, and major/minor tags), SBOM generation, and GitHub release creation with artifacts.

The `docker-build-push.yml` workflow runs on every push to main and publishes intermediate Docker images (`main`, `sha-*`, timestamp tags). It prunes old non-release images automatically after each build. The weekly `prune-ghcr.yml` workflow handles any remaining cleanup.

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md for details and anti-patterns.

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
