# 🌌 Sidereal: Self-Hosted Astrophotography Management System

## 1. 🌟 Introduction

**Sidereal** is a **self-hosted, privacy-focused photo gallery and asset management system** designed specifically for astrophotographers. It addresses the critical need for specialized metadata management, intelligent celestial object identification, and equipment tracking—all missing in general-purpose photo management tools.

The primary goal is to provide a single, secure platform for astrophotographers to store their images and automatically enrich them with the highly technical, scientific metadata required for the hobby, without sacrificing data ownership or privacy.
