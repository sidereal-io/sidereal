# Test-Driven Development

Use the repository's existing test tooling and conventions.

One test, one behavior, one reason to fail. A test name describes that one
behavior; never use joiners such as "and", "or", or "etc." to combine
independent outcomes. Use several assertions only when together they
establish that one behavior.

## Red

- Select one observable behavior from the requirement.
- Write one test before changing implementation code.
- Run the test and confirm it fails because the behavior is missing, not because the test is broken.

## Green

- Write only enough implementation code to pass the failing test.
- Run the test, then run the relevant suite.
- Do not add behavior without first seeing its test fail.

## Refactor

- Refactor only while the relevant suite is green, after completing a red-green slice.
- Refactor either the tests or the implementation in one pass, not both.
- Reuse shared setup, teardown, helpers, and parameterized structure when they clarify intent without combining behaviors.
- Rerun the relevant suite after each refactor pass.

## Patterns and anti-patterns

Read [patterns and anti-patterns](references/best-practices.md) when choosing a test shape, writing examples, or deciding whether cases belong together.

## Collaborators

Read [collaborators](references/collaborators.md) before substituting a dependency. Mock system boundaries, not code owned by the application.
